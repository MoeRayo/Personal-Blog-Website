                <h1 class="main-blog--head">A Productively Unproductive Week</h1>
                <p class="main-blog--info">Posted on January 18, 2020 by moronfolu motunrayo.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I am writing this with excitement, but not as excited as I could have been, considering I just became certified in “responsive web development” – <em>responsive what??</em>, I just said that to make it look like I did something really spectacular (Why can’t I be excited?).</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">My lack of excitement can be attributed to the fact that I neglected a lot of things this week for my programming – I could neither do the regular extracurricular reading nor could I focus on other sides of my growth journey – which I see as insufficient discipline and not enough planning on my part <em>(I hope to put this in retrospect when planning for the next week)</em>.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--info">Huh, so let’s dive into how I spent the past week.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I spent nothing less than 15hours each day staring at my laptop screen and I must confess that my already bad eyes has taken a turn for the worse – don’t blame me, blame programming instead, sometimes it is so interesting and tasking that it is hard to just shut your system and take a break.</p>
                <h2 class="main-blog-inner--mainhead">Projects</h2>
                <p class="main-blog--para">One of my experienced developer friends would always tell me that the best way to learn programming is to build something – something so complex that you would begin to question why you decided to ever be a programmer.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I embarked on that journey this week – although not willingly – it was a requirement to get a certificate on one of my learning paths. I was given five projects to do – <em>five is small right? just as I thought</em> – and I envisaged myself doing it in a short time without undergoing much stress <em>(such confidence)</em>.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">First Project</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">The first project went almost seamless, I finished it in record time and was undoubtedly proud of myself. It was a Tribute page for Dr. Norman Borlaug who saved tons of life during his lifetime.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">Second Project</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">This was even sweeter <em>(I’m laughing in a not too funny way)</em> and I wrapped this up quite early. I created a survey form – life would have been quite sweet for developers if all we had to do was to create forms.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">Third project</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">Lol, this was where real life started for me. I slept on this, I was hit with different wave of emotions – from trying to hit my head on the wall to smashing my laptop on the floor, to sleeping, to wondering how wicked it was to set such project!</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">All the projects had specifications and the specification of this particular project had to do with adding media query – for my non-tech readers, it means the page should be built in such a way that it would adapt to different screen i.e It would look good on a mobile device, tablet or large screen without the user having to scroll around or leaving the page with sheer desperation. The desperation I was trying to not make my users had what was I had to go through to get it to work.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I know you can keep a secret, so I will tell you that I built the page from scratch three times and only got what I wanted at the last attempt, I also used two days to build it – on the second day I jolted up from bed with "line 8" in my mouth, I saw the solution to one of the bugs distressing my code in my sleep (don’t be worried, I am not going nuts – yet!), as if that wasn’t enough, I had to fall sick the third day from the mental exercise I went through.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">You are probably wondering why I didn’t give up; I couldn’t because I remembered that men erected no monuments, nor do they weave laurels for those who give up. I told myself that if others could pass this stage then there was absolutely nothing stopping me from getting it done.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I would have reached out to people, but I knew I could do it, I just wasn’t applying the rules well and while I battled with this project, I did two weird but effective things:</p>
                <div class="post-list-container">
                    <ul>
                        <li class="post-list">
                            I started talking to my key-holder
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <img class="main-blog--image" src="images/keyholder.jpg" alt="Moronfolu Olufunke's keyholder">
                <p class="main-blog--para">	I had to dump my laptop for some minutes cos I felt it was over-heating and giving me wrong output (I was right, it was tired). I whipped out my old diary and started writing what I thought would be the right thing, all the while talking to my key-holder about the reason for each value and why I think one would work and the other wouldn’t.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">The discussion I had with my mute but cute little key-holder did a lot of magic, it was like the theraphy I needed. I haven’t written any line of code without it by my side – I have it beside me at the moment.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">Fourth project</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">It wasn’t as stressful as the third project, despite my use of media queries while building it. It was a Javascript documentation – Javascript is a programming language, a language I can’t wait to start learning.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">Fifth project</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">This was a personal portfolio, I must confess that I suck at picking colours.</p>
                <!-- lessons learnt -->
                <h2 class="main-blog-inner--mainhead">The lessons I learnt…</h2>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">The tech lesson:</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">Jen – one of my teachers – would always say that:" when you are confused, stick a border on it".</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">For the developers (newbies like me), when you are finding it hard to place an element the way you want, just stick a border on it. Sticking borders on things would clear your doubts about how it is displaying, the width it is occupying and so many things</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I was able to successfully complete my third project (I thought the project was going to finish me) because of that piece of advice. My favourite is: 3px solid red – lol, I think my editor is tired of seeing me write that line of code every time.</p>
                <p class="main-blog-inner--head">Non-tech lesson:</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">You shouldn’t give up on anything, if others have done it before, then you can – you can even do it better (even if your idea is novel, you should not give up either). Don’t utter words like: “this book isn’t for me”, “this career isn’t for me”, or “oh no, this is too tough for me”, you can do it and when it looks like no one is cheering you up, know that I’m secretly rooting for you and can’t wait to see you attain great heights.</p>
                <!-- other goals -->
                <h2 class="main-blog-inner--mainhead">Update on other goals</h2>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I have substituted my morning work out with “walking out” in the evening, I have been taking 40minutes walk every to make up for my inability to do the regular push-ups, planks and whatever – so I guess I am doing fine.</p>
                <!-- ammendments -->
                <h2 class="main-blog-inner--mainhead">Ammendments</h2>
                <p class="main-blog--para">It looks like I have gained a lot in the past week but it doesn’t feel like that to me – I was focused on just one thing.</p>
                <p class="main-blog--para">I hope to plan my day well and make sure I find a way to balance everything, because what is progress when it is one-sided?</p>
